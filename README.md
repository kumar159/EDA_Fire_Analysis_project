# EDA_Fire_Analysis_project

The dataset includes 244 instances that regroup a data of two regions of Algeria,namely the Bejaia region located in the northeast of Algeria and the Sidi Bel-abbes region located in the northwest of Algeria.

122 instances for each region.

The period from June 2012 to September 2012. The dataset includes 11 attribues and 1 output attribue (class) The 244 instances have been classified into fire(138 classes) and not fire (106 classes) classes.

1) I cleaned the data by handling missing values and converting the data type of some columns from object to int to save memory.
2) Next, I performed EDA on the cleaned data and dropped columns that were not relevant to the target variable.
3) I then visualized the data using heatmaps and boxplots to better understand correlations and identify outliers.
4) Finally, I used a countplot to analyze which regions and months experienced higher or lower occurrences of fire.
